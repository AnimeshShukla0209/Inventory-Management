# Inventory-Management

First , I created an inventory of txt file which contains the following contents :
1. ID of product
2. Name of product
3. Price of product
4. Quantity of product

I used user input method to get the input for ID of product . I used if else condition so that when user input ID matches the ID of product it will 
display the details of product . 
The user will give the quantity of product he needs , if there is enough quantity available , it will print the bill but if not it will ask if he needs 
the left quantity.
If he needs the left quantity and says "Y" it will print the bill with following bill with user Name, Gmail ID, phone no
